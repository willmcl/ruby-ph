title: 'Designer, Writer, Illustrator'
intro: >-
  Ruby’s personal work is anchored by colour and purposefully free from a
  singular medium.


  Ruby’s short form work is primarily illustrated online content and creative
  assets produced for online mediums like gifs and face filters.


  Their larger bodies of work are often motivated by geometry, documentation,
  collection and how mediums themselves communicate ideas.

Hire Ruby to write, illustrate or design something for you.

Don’t hire Ruby for photography, 3D design or editing, they don’t do it.
